## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze the recruitment funnel from application to joining  
- Identify stages with the highest candidate drop-offs  
- Evaluate application inflow vs actual hires by source  
- Measure hire conversion rates  
- Analyze average time-to-hire  
- Provide a clear, executive-ready dashboard for decision-making
